Hi this is a classificaiton of MNIST dataset using a simple deep learning classifier.
In the history of deep learning, the accurate image classification of the MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, was a major development. While today the problem is considered trivial, doing image classification with MNIST has become a kind of "Hello World" for deep learning.

Here are 40 of the images included in the MNIST dataset:

the assignment was done in the #Nvidia deep learning coursework.
